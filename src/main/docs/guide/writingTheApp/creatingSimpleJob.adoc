Create a file and add the following:

[source, groovy]
.src/main/groovy/example/micronaut/HelloWorldJob.groovy
----
include::{sourceDir}/src/main/groovy/example/micronaut/HelloWorldJob.groovy[]
----

<1> To register a Singleton in Micronaut's application context annotate your class with `javax.inject.Singleton`
<2> `@Slf4j` local transform adds a logging ability to the bean.
<3> Create trigger every 10 seconds
<4> Create another trigger every 45 seconds with an initial delay of 5 seconds (5000 millis)

&nbsp;

Now start the application:

[source, bash]
----
./gradlew run
----

And after a few seconds you will see the following output:

[source, bash]
---
... Simple Job every 10 seconds :15/5/2018 12:48:02 <1>
... Simple Job every 45 seconds :15/5/2018 12:48:07 <2>
... Simple Job every 10 seconds :15/5/2018 12:48:12 <3>
