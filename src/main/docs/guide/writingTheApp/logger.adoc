During this guide, we are going to use several log statements to show Job execution.

Add at the end of `logback.xml` the next statement:

[source, xml]
.src/main/resources/logback.xml
----
<configuration>
...
..
.
include::{sourceDir}/src/main/resources/logback.xml[tag=logger]
</configuration>
----

The above line configures a logger for package `example.micronaut` with log level INFO.
