Although the previous example is valid, usually you don't want to put your business logic in a Job. A better approach is to create an additional bean which the `Job` invokes. This approach decouples your business logic from the scheduling logic. Moreover, it facilitates testing and maintenance. Letâ€™s see an example:

Create the following use case:

[source, groovy]
.src/main/groovy/example/micronaut/EmailUseCase.groovy
----
include::{sourceDir}/src/main/groovy/example/micronaut/EmailUseCase.groovy[]
----

And then the job:

[source, groovy]
.src/main/groovy/example/micronaut/DailyEmailJob.groovy
----
include::{sourceDir}/src/main/groovy/example/micronaut/DailyEmailJob.groovy[]
----

<1> To register a Singleton in Micronaut's application context annotate your class with `javax.inject.Singleton`
<2> Constructor injection.
<3> Trigger the job once a day at 04:30 AM
<4> Call the injected use case
